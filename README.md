TriviaGame Assignment #5 GA Tech Bootcamp
<br>
## About Game:
This is a basic trivia game which uses a combination of vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. 
<br>

### Objective:
<br>

### Buttons:
<p> The play button first initializes the sound and executes the start of the game. 
  The sound button then turns the sound on and off, depending on whether it is playing or not.
  The reset button essentially takes the user back to the start of the game, but if the sound is playing, it stops it, and vice versa.
  The end game button does the same thing that the reset button does, but, does so in a way that might be more semantically pleasing to some users. 
  The exit button closes the game page. </p>
<br>

## Note:
<p>Most of this assignment is done in jQuery.</p> 
<p>The most important vanilla JavaScript function linked the audio to the sound button as attaching events to dynamically-
created buttons is not a strong-suit of jQuery</p>
