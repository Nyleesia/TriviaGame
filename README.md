TriviaGame Assignment #5 GA Tech Bootcamp

## About Game:
This is a basic trivia game which uses a combination of vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. 

### Objective:
<p> The objective of this game is to get as many of the questions right as possible.</p>

### Buttons:
<p> The play button first initializes the sound and executes the start of the game. </p>
  <p>The sound button then turns the sound on and off, depending on whether it is playing or not.</p>
  <p>The reset button essentially takes the user back to the start of the game, but if the sound is playing, it stops it, and vice versa.</p>
  <p>The end game button does the same thing that the reset button does, but, does so in a way that might be more semantically pleasing to some users. </p>
  The exit button closes the game page. </p>

## Note:
<p>Most of this assignment is done in jQuery.</p> 
<p>The most important vanilla JavaScript function linked the audio to the sound button as attaching events to dynamically-
created buttons is not a strong-suit of jQuery</p>
